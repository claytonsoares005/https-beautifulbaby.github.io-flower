      "<b>Petal 1:</b> I am so eternally greatful for you babaluuu.",
      "<b>Petal 2:</b> I miss you so much. We're so close yet so far. I think about you so often my baby and can't help but wonder why I can't just teleport over there to give you hugs, kisses and love that would make both our hearts melt.",
      "<b>Petal 3:</b> You are not only my girlfriend, you are my daughter, you are my best friend, you are my solemate, and you are my everything and I will never give up on you, no matter how many times you think I may breakup with you. Take my hand baba. Its alright. I will hold your precious warm hands forever. Whenever you feel cold, I'll always be there to warm them up.",
      "<b>Petal 4:</b> I never imagined someone staying with me through my worst, but you have done all of that and I am so shocked. I really get emotional over the fact that I've quite literally never experienced something like this ever in my life. I am forever thankful for the times you stuck by me, no matter how much of a wreak I was. Through every dispute you really did everything to help me stay alive and find purpose in life.",
      "<b>Petal 5:</b> Although, I wanted to send you a real flower, I'm really sorry baba. I really didn't know how I was supposed to deliver them to you especially when you were on semester ending holidays. I hope you like it. It's not that great I know. I had lots of trouble aligning the Lilly.",
      "<b>Petal 6:</b> Baby, you are such a beauty to look at. You are a perfect mixture of sweet and bitchy but I love it. I can relate to you in so many ways, but if you think those are the only three reasons I love you, that couldn't be further from the truth. I also love you because I can see a future with you. A future of love and fun adventures. I see you through the bad and good times. No matter what, if I were to choose a person to be with for the rest of my life weather its a friend or you, I'd choose you without hesitation, every single time.",
      "<b>Petal 7</b>: You will forever be my one and only dance partner, in person or in spirit. I miss my dance partner so much. We had such a blast and I'd do anything to get any little moment of that back. I loved acting like cringed out idiots that danced the night away. For a shy person like me, I never thought I'd see myself this active or talkitive before. Not like this especially. That was the first and only time I've ever couldn't care less about another persons opinion.",
      "<b>Petal 8:</b> In my Lilly, there are 8 flowers, and I love you infinatly more than my Lilly could show you. 💐"
